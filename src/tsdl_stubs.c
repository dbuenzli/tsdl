   If not, MSVC will not link the SDL2 import library and subsequently the
   SDL2 DLL will not be implicitly linked (aka. load-time dynamic linking)
   to the TSDL stub DLL. That can be verified with Unix `ldd` or MSVC
   `dumpbin /imports`.
   ctypes-foreign, in particular ctypes_win32_dlsym_rtld_default(), requires
   that all foreign DLLs are already mapped into the process address space.
   Implicit linking is the simplest way to do that.
