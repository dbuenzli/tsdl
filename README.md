## Installation

Tsdl needs the C library SDL 2.0.5 or later installed on your
system. Tsdl can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install tsdl

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for
build instructions and a complete specification of the dependencies.

## Sample programs

Sample programs are located in the `test` directory of the
distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test` :

- `test.native`, tests the bindings, the executable should exit 
   with 0.
- `sdlevents.native`, traces SDL events.
- `min.native` a minimal SDL example.
