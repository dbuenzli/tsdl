---------------------------------

- Fix segfaulting `Sdl.load_raw_rw`. Thanks to @sanette for the

  wrapping is now done via the `Sdl.audio_callback` function. The
  client must keep a reference on the returned value until no longer
  needed.  As a side effect this changes the signature of
  `Sdl.load_raw_rw`. Thanks to @sanette for the report.
