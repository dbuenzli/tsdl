v0.9.0 2015-11-30 Cambridge (UK)
--------------------------------

* Switch from a polymorphic variant result type to the one exposed by
  the `result` compatibility package. This is an incompatible
  change. Thanks to Florian Angeletti for the patch.


v0.8.2 2015-11-20 Cambridge (UK)
--------------------------------

* ctypes >= 0.4.0 support.
* Remove support for audio callback, leads to segfaults.
  See issue #13 for more information.
* Release the OCaml runtime lock on `Sdl.wait_event[_timeout]`.
* Fix constant error messages that shouldn't be. Thanks
  to Vũ Ngọc San for the report.
* Fix signature of `Sdl.blit_surface`, thanks to Frederic
  Bour for the report.
* Change toplevel scheme. Require `tsdl.top` instead of `tsdl` for toplevel
  support.
* Add `Sdl.Color.set_{r,g,b,a}`, `Point.set_{x,y}` and
  `Color.set_{x,y,w,h}`. Thanks to Julian Squires for the patch.
* Add a few new, undocumented `unsafe_*_of_ptr` conversion functions.
  This allows to develop bindings to other C libraries that manipulate
  SDL structures. Thanks to Frederic Bour and Julian Squires for
  the patches.
